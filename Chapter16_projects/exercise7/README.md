### Exercise 7
Assume that the `fraction`structure contains two members: `numerator` and `denominator`(both of type `int`). Write functions that perform the following operations on fractions:

(a) Reduce the fraction `f` to lowest terms.

(b) Add the fractions `f1`and `f2`.

(c) Subtract the fraction `f2` from the fraction `f1`.

(d) Multiply the fractions `f1` and `f2`.

(e) Divide the fraction `f1` by the fraction `f2`.

The fractions `f`, `f1` and `f2` will be arguments of type `struct fraction`; each function will return a value of type `struct fraction`. The fractions returnved by the functions in parts (b)-(e) should be reduced to lowest terms.
