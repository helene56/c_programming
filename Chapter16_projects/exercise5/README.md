Write the following functions, assuming that the `date` structure contains three members: `month`, `day` and `year` (all type `int`).
(a)
    int day_of_year(struct date d);
Returns the day of the year (an integer between 1 and 366) that corresponds to the date `d`.
(b)     int compare_dates(struct date d1, struct date d2);
