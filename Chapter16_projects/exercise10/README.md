### Exercise 10
The following structures are designed to store information about objects on a graphics screen:

```
struct point { int x, y; };
struct rectangle { struct point upper_left, lower_right; };
```

A `point` structure stores the `x` and `y` coordinates of a point on the screen. A `rectangle` structure stores the coordinates of the upper left and lower right corners of a rectangle. Write functions that perform the following operations on a `rectangle` structure `r` passed as an argument:

(a) Compute the area of `r`.

(b) Compute the center of `r`, returning it as a `point` value. If either the `x` or `y` coordinate of the center isn't an integer, store its truncated value in the `point` structure.

(c) Move `r` by `x` units in the *x* direction and `y` units in the *y* direction, returning the modified version of `r`. (`x` and `y` are additional arguments to the function.)

(d) Determine whether a point `p` lies within `r`, returning `true` or `false`. (`p` is an additional argument of type `struct point`.)
