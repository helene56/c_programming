### Exercise 3
(a) Show how to declare a tag named `complex` for a structure with two members, `real` and `imaginary`, of type `double`.
(b) Use the `complex` tag to declare variables named `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`.
(c) Write a function named `make_complex` that stores its two arguments (both of type `double`) in a `complex` structure, then returns the structure.
