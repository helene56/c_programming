### Exercise 5
Suppose that a program consists of three source fules - main.c, f1.c, and f2.c - plus two header files, f1.h and f2.h.
All three source files include f1.h, but only f1.c and f2.c include f2.h. 
Write a makefile for this program, assuming that the compiler is gcc and that the executeable file is to be named demo.
